## Scope of the project

The aim of the project was to build a website using Rest Api from 'weatherapi.com'. At the beginning, the user will see an input field where he can choose a city. After typing 3 characters, the attached cities will be shown with autocomplete. Once it's clicked, the weather details will be shown on a card and some additional extra details using animation effects.
